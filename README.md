The jupyter notebook file contains example code for four common operations on TIME data. For details about the TIME study or the datasets, please refer to the [TIME study website](https://timestudydocumentation.github.io/).

# Example code
1. Convert local time string to timestamp
2. Match personal-daybreak days in study to timestamp
3. Match nearest-time sensor log to timestamp
4. X-min window of sensor data aggregates before/after timestamp

# How to run the code
1. Download the example_scripts.ipynb or clone this repo to your local machine
2. Open the example_scripts.ipynb using Jupyter notebook or google colab
3. Test the code as it is
4. Modify the code for customized purposes
